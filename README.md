Build pwnagotchis using armbian-build and eventually pi-gen and others

Work in progress. I have armbian-build working using some modified pi-gen scripts (that probably don't work in pi-gen anymore). I can build pwnagotchi for a few different boards that are supported by Armbian. I will eventually check that in here.

Once I get the files in, I want to set this up with armbian-build and pi-gen as submodules, so I can check them out, and have a Makefile in here or something that will configure them to use these scripts to build the pwny.
